  			    Thank you for visiting the Democracy Counts 2016 General Election Audit portal. The upcoming election is an important one and we are here to help people like you to collaborate with your friends and neighbors to establish community driven, independent audits of official election results on November 8th.
            <br>
            <br>
            Money, time, skills, supplies, networking, promotion, etc. - everyone has something valuable to contribute to this effort and now is the time we need to organize ourselves and stand together to protect the integrity of American Democracy.
            <br><br>
            There are multiple goals we can accomplish with this collaborative effort and the scope of those goals changes with the scale of community involvement.  
            <br><br>
            Please use the top left main menu to read more about our non-profit, our objectives and potential impact on this election and the broader political system, learn more about the audit procedure and our free tools, register to volunteer on election day, donate money to help ensure the success of our efforts and offset expenses for volunteers, learn how to effectively promote the audit and participate in other valuable ways. 
            <br><br>
            It is up to all of us to protect the integrity of this election and work for the political system we deserve.

            <ion-list-header>About Us</ion-list-header>
            <ion-item text-wrap>
            Our mission is to ensure the integrity of democratic elections by providing citizens the tools to audit their own elections.
            <br><br>

            Free and fair elections are a core principle of democracy. They hold leaders accountable and are the first step in creating trust in government and law.
            <br>
            <br>

            Our system empowers citizens to monitor elections for fraudulent activity and hold officials accountable. In cases where official results vary significantly from audit results, the evidence produced during the audit will meet the judicial standard required for an injunction against certification of the results and ordering an investigation.

            <ion-list-header>About Volunteering</ion-list-header>
            <ion-item text-wrap>
            Being an volunteer auditor is arguably one of the most important ways to contribute to the success of this effort. We have worked hard to streamline the community organization process for you so that volunteering will be easy, fun and our collective results will be standardized, fully aggregated and powerful. 
            <br><br>
            All you need to do is register to volunteer on election day then find a polling location listing near you and sign up for one or more shifts. 
            <br><br>
            By allowing volunteers to add their own locations to our list, our online tools facilitate the ability of individuals to independently establish an infinitely scalable amount of auditing teams across the nation. If there is no polling location near you on the list already then simply initiate a new audit by adding one.

   <ion-list-header>About Shifts</ion-list-header>
   <ion-item text-wrap>
    Once you sign up, if you need to cancel or reschedule your shifts, edit them from your 'Account' menu option. It is important to do this if your plans change so that your other team members know how many volunteers are still needed for each shift. 
    <br><br>
    Shifts are three hours long with fifteen minute grace periods at the end to allow enough time for volunteers to transition in and out. Those finishing a shift should help the incoming new volunteers to sign in and understand how to use the app.
    <br><br>
    We would really like some dedicated volunteers to take two consecutive shifts, especially early morning and late evening shifts bc the morning and evening procedures need to be taken care of by someone who has invested time and knows what they are doing. It would be preferable if two or three people would take on team lead responsibility and stay the entire day, or do all the shifts except the middle two so they can take a long break, but we know that is an extremely long day and not realistic in every case.

   <ion-list-header>About Polling Stations</ion-list-header>
   <ion-item text-wrap>
    When attempting to choose a polling station from the list, you may not see a listing close enough to your location. If there are no audit initiated near you already, then initiate one yourself by adding a polling location to our list. Please try to help promote the audit and network with friends and neighbors in your community to fill the shifts.
    <br><br>
    There are a few ways that audits can be successful. The best way is to have a very well staffed audit with at least the recommended amount of volunteers present at all times. The reason for this is because, unlike an exit poll that only samples portion of voter data, an audit strives to get data from as close to 100% of exiting voters as possible. 
    <br><br>
    Voters exiting polling stations are generally glad to participate in the audit, but they don't want to spend time waiting for other voters to finish before their turn. So when a station is understaffed, the chances of getting as close to 100% of voters decreases.
    <br><br>
    We understand that not every polling location will be able to be adequately staffed, and that is ok too although not preferable and this is why: data gathered by an understaffed polling station audit that does not get close to 100% of exiting voters to participate can still be used as exit <i>polling</i> data. This data is also very helpful for understanding if fraud is taking place although it is not actionable in court the way audit data will be. So if you are trying to get a polling station staffed, don't despair if there are not enough volunteers. However, if your station is substantailly understaffed we recommend joining another close by polling station's effort instead. It is better to have one well staffed audit than two less well staffed exit polls.
