Our mission is to ensure the integrity of democratic elections by providing citizens the tools to audit their own elections.
<br><br>

Free and fair elections are a core principle of democracy. They hold leaders accountable and are the first step in creating trust in government and law.
<br>
<br>

Our system empowers citizens to monitor elections for fraudulent activity and hold officials accountable. In cases where official results vary significantly from audit results, the evidence produced during the audit will meet the judicial standard required for an injunction against certification of the results and ordering an investigation.
