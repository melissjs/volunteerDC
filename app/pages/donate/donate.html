  Donations to Democracy Counts are tax deductible via our legal relationship with the Institute for American Democracy and Election Integrity (www.trustvote.org) and the Sunrise Center (www.sunrisecenter.org); both are 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations. Because of the bookkeeping burden we cannot provide receipts for small donations. You can still claim the deduction on your tax return, however (consult your tax adviser). Donations of $50 or more will receive formal receipts. Thank you for your contribution! 
Without your support we couldn't support the individuals volunteering their time and skillsets to our cause.
