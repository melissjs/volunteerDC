  			    Thank you for visiting the Democracy Counts 2016 General Election Audit portal. The upcoming election is an important one and we are here to help people like you to collaborate with your friends and neighbors to establish community driven, independent audits of official election results on November 8th.
            <br>
            <br>
            Money, time, skills, supplies, networking, promotion, etc. - everyone has something valuable to contribute to this effort and now is the time we need to organize ourselves and stand together to protect the integrity of American Democracy.
            <br><br>
            There are multiple goals we can accomplish with this collaborative effort and the scope of those goals changes with the scale of community involvement.  
            <br><br>
            Please use the top left main menu to read more about our non-profit, our objectives and potential impact on this election and the broader political system, learn more about the audit procedure and our free tools, register to volunteer on election day, donate money to help ensure the success of our efforts and offset expenses for volunteers, learn how to effectively promote the audit and participate in other valuable ways. 
            <br><br>
            It is up to all of us to protect the integrity of this election and work for the political system we deserve.
