    There are a few ways that audits can be successful. The best way is to have a very well staffed audit with at least the recommended amount of volunteers present at all times. The reason for this is because, unlike an exit poll that only samples portion of voter data, an audit strives to get data from as close to 100% of exiting voters as possible. 
    <br><br>
    Voters exiting polling stations are generally glad to participate in the audit, but they don't want to spend time waiting for other voters to finish before their turn. So when a station is understaffed, the chances of getting as close to 100% of voters decreases.
    <br><br>
    We understand that not every polling location will be able to be adequately staffed, and that is ok too although not preferable and this is why: data gathered by an understaffed polling station audit that does not get close to 100% of exiting voters to participate can still be used as exit <i>polling</i> data. This data is also very helpful for understanding if fraud is taking place although it is not actionable in court the way audit data will be. So if you are trying to get a polling station staffed, don't despair if there are not enough volunteers. However, if your station is substantailly understaffed we recommend joining another close by polling station's effort instead. It is better to have one well staffed audit than two less well staffed ones.
