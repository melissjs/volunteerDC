Being an volunteer auditor is arguably one of the most important ways to contribute to the success of this effort. We have worked hard to streamline the community organization process for you so that volunteering will be easy, fun and our collective results will be standardized, fully aggregated and powerful. 
<br><br>
All you need to do is register to volunteer on election day then find a polling location listing near you and sign up for one or more shifts. 
<br><br>
By allowing volunteers to add their own locations to our list, our online tools facilitate the ability of individuals to independently establish an infinitely scalable amount of auditing teams across the nation. If there is no polling location near you on the list already then simply initiate a new audit by adding one.
